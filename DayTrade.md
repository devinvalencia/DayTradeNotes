  ### Image Notes (Above)

    - Pushed stock with no resistance from sellers
    - Even tug of war, sign of indecision

  ### Image Notes (Above)
    - Long top wick following an uptrend suggests an iminate downtrend

# Section 4 - Support & Resistance
  - **Resistance** - More sellers than buyers, stock price has trouble passing this high
   - **Support** - More Buyers than sellers, stock price has trouble passing this low

**SELL NEAR RESISTANCE, BUY NEAR SUPPORT**
- These are identified using past data

## Identifying Support & Resistances
This first requires that we find the 'floors' by finding swing highs & lows

>Swing High - Where price rises up and curves back down

>Swing Low - Where price goes down and curves back up

Use previous day's data

1) Draw upside U on swing highs = Resistance
2) Draw parellel lines on U's
3) Draw U on swing lows = Support
4) Draw parelell lines to those
5) Those are the Resistances & Support
>Whicks count as the tips in these !!!, don't draw through candle itself

Stocks test these floors all day, but these map out areas where the stock can get stopped at

S & R lines can be diagnole on down trending or uptrending stocks

Use half & whole values to set

**Only trade around Daily S & R**

Use 1 min to get faster read during trade days
Use 5 min to get read on S & R

**Strategy example**
  1) Buy at support, set stop a little below
  2) Sell at first resistance
  3) Buy at breakout, set stop a little below
  4) Sell at second resistance

!! Dont buy as soon as resistance breaks since often it is false breakout and price will drop

Need to wait for resistance to turn into support before buying on breakout

This finds support after breakout, the upside L (called Bullflag)

>## **GAPS** - When a stock opens much higher or lower than the previous's day's close

## Once price reaches to INSIDE GAP, the prices rise up to fill the gap, top of gap is resistance and bottom is support
---
## **Moving Averages (MA)**
- Only other indicator used besides volume is moving averages, can act as S&R
- Auto calculate price over time period
  - Example, Wanted 20 Moving Average on 1 Minute chart, then this gives average price based on the last 20 (1 min) candles
- MA differ depending on timeframe examined

**UpTrending** - Stock trading above MA
**DownTrending** - Stock trading below MA

Stocks tend to ride or bounce off of MA in intra-day and daily action

>**EMA Exponential Movement Average** - calculates like MA, but emphasizes latest prices over older ones
  - Dont need these on daily chart, want to use only on intra-day analysis

  ## **[ ! ! ! ] IMPORTANT**
    - Need to MAP out S&R's from MAs on Daily charts + S&R's from swings! 
    - Use 50, 100 & 200 MA for dailys.
    - Ignore stocks with lots of resistnace overhead?
